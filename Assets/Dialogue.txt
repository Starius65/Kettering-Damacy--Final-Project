Ah, Kettering University. |The home place of automotive training programs, awkward academic terms,|and tenth-week tears. The home of our beloved dog, woof? |Now, let's see here... how big is the katamari now, prince? |...Ah, about 10cm. We think the katamari should be about 1m. A decent goal, woof? |We can believe in you for around 5 minutes earth time, but any longer and even |The General of all Determination can't be expected to wait. |Don't forget that you can use (<) and (>) to change the song on the radio. |We look forward to the full-size katamari, fledgling prince...
Okay, time is up, we have to get back to space now. |The students and their tears of finals will be here any moment. |Royal Rainbow!
So, little prince, how was earth? Was Kettering as lovely as I remember? Hm? |What do you mean it was deserted? Was no one there to see our great work? |Oh well. We have stars to be remaking for father, and we can't let the |inattention of lazy students get in the way.|Let's see... the katamari is about [Size]. 
A decent job on your first run, but we would have made it much bigger, woof. |My, Kettering truly is full of things. I wonder how they manage it. |We will now release it into the sky.
What is this? You didn't even make the first goal?|Well, that is a pity, tiny prince. But we will not let that get us down... |yet.|For now, let us release the Katamari into the sky.
Let us hope this "Nathan" will not miss this.
Ah! A symbol of me, how elegant. 
We did always like this for breakfast. 
Our favorite candy, woof.
This certainly looks expensive.
still a long way to go, woof.
still just a freshman.
70cm… not as big as we thought. 
Ah, what a nice Katamari. Not too small, not too big. |But not really, we would like it bigger. |We will leave the prince to his work then.

This next part for a potential constellation level.
Constellation: Horologium 

Sending things to earth…
Ah, back at Kettering again, woof. |We still think the sky is missing something though, woof. |Ah yes! It has no sense of +Time+. No sense of when the sun rises or falls. |No sense of when to sleep. Though that does not exist here, anyways. |There are many clocks and watches and other time pieces around here today. |it must be finals week. |We would like to put time back in the sky soon, not that we can tell when soon is, woof. |But we will let you feel it out, around 3 minutes should be enough. |You need no time keeper, right? You are skilled at counting time, woof? |Hopefully we can tell when 3 minutes have passed. Hurry now, impatient prince. |
Late! We are very much late! |No, wait, we are on time. 3 minutes have passed. |Let us return to space now, before we lose the time again. 
Ah, I can barely think with all this ticking, woof. |(# clocks) clocks… It is enough. We can at least count the seconds again. |Let us now release this into the sky.
